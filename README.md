# Discord-TTS-Bot
Currently trying to develop a discord bot (with discord.js) which will read tts from chat to call. I am using code from youtube tutorials, along with various documentation and examples online, i'm learning as I go lol. 
Even though other versions exist, this one aims to add more features such as giving specific people certain voices, instead of reading each name in a specific voice. (Maybe giving users the option of using either or)

NOTE: Wherever I have "REMINDER" written as a comment, is where the text needs to be either replaced with a server id, or token for your specific discord application
